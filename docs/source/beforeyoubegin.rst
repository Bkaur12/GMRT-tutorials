Prerequisites
==============

GMRT data (continuum/spectral line) can be analysed using NRAO's 
Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) or Astronomical Image Processing System (AIPS).
We will focus on the analysis using CASA in these tutorials.

CASA
-----

You need to install the latest version of CASA. You can find the instructions to do so 
over **here**.
It is important to read the **CASA documentation** in order to understand the details of 
the CASA tasks and the overall functioning of CASA.
It will be useful to get familiar with the **usage of CASA** at the ipython prompt before 
starting the tutorials.
The specific CASA version in which the tutorial was prepared is provided at the beginning 
of the individual tutorials.
